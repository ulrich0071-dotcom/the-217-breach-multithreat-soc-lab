# Phase 0 — Foundation

Goal: clean, isolated lab with Splunk ingesting Windows + Linux logs via Universal Forwarders (UF).

## What’s here
- VMware host‑only network plan (document your exact subnet)
- Core Splunk indexes to create
- Example UF configs (Windows & Linux) **sanitized** (replace placeholders on your machine)
- Health dashboard (ingestion sanity)

## Next
Phase 1 — Credential Abuse & Brute Force (build detection + dashboard + KPIs).
